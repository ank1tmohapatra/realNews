            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Offices shut, hundreds of employees resigned, thousands fired: Elon Musk’s Twitter is in a mess</h1>
            <p>There has been a lot of chaos at Twitter HQ lately. It all started ever since Elon Musk 
                took over the company. A couple of few days ago, the billionaire fired as many as 50 
                per cent of the workforce globally, including around 90 per cent working from India. 
                Now, some of the retained Twitter staff have resigned after Musk sent an “ultimatum” 
                email that ordered everyone to be ready for Twitter 2.0 and be ready for a hardcore 
                culture or leave with three months pay. In the last email that Musk sent to Twitter employees, 
                he announced some major changes around work culture, work hours, and remote work. The Twitter 
                boss said that employees who wish to be a part of Twitter 2.0 must commit to a “hardcore” 
                culture or leave with severance pay. He also ordered employees to sign an online form committing to 
                “long hours at high intensity” by clicking on the “yes” option in the mail. While some of the employees 
                must have agreed to Musk’s Twitter 2.0 rules, many didn’t and left the company with three months salary.

            <h2 style="color: brown; text-align: center;">Elon Musk's Twitter 2.0</h2>
            <p>There’s so much happening at Twitter each day that one might just get confused. 
                So, here’s a quick recap of everything that happened at Twitter this week and 
                how Musk is planning to build Twitter 2.0.Starting of the week, Musk fired nearly 
                4000 contract employees out of 5500. Just like Musk did to previously laid off employees, 
                he didn’t inform impacted employees before firing them. Impacted employees reportedly 
                found that they are laid off only after losing access to the company’s email and internal 
                communications systems. Both US-based and global employees working in content moderation, 
                real estate, marketing, engineering, and other departments were affected. It appears that Musk doesn’t like 
                suggestions/feedback from anyone. A Twitter engineer who fact checked Musk when he said Twitter is slow in 
                “many countries” was fired publicly on the platform. Eric Frohnhoefer, now the former Twitter engineer, 
                publically dismissed Musk’s claim on Twitter’s speed. The billionaire also took to Twitter to announce that 
                he had been fired.
